# Tiny-Encryption-Algorithm-using-Cypherblock-chaining
Encryption and decryption within a chain of blocks of according the specification of CBC 


modifing the algorithm (TEA) to use Cypher Block Chaining. This algorithm will use the encryption and decryption algorithms within a chain of blocks according the specifications of CBC (64 bit block size). Otput is supposed to be able to show the entire message or even portions of the message both encrypted and then later decrypted.
